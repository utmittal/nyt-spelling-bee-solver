### nyt_spelling_bee_dictionary.txt

A dictionary of words that may be possible solutions for the NYT spelling bee. This dictionary is compiled from multiple
sources and is periodically updated based on recent puzzles. The NYT doesn't use a fixed dictionary. For example, there
have been words that were not accepted for previous puzzles that were accepted for newer puzzles. So this dictionary is
unlikely to ever be fully correct, but it's as close as it gets.

Note: the dictionary is tailored for the NYT spelling bee puzzle, so it doesn't contain any words smaller than 4
letters, longer than 19 letters or containing more than 7 distinct letters.
